### Profile

Due to my work history i gained experience in organization of various events and working with people.
But once i felt craving for some other sphere where i could make things i can be proud of. I started to attend courses of graphic design, and as a result discovered for myself front-end development.
After some time of self-learning HTML, CSS and JS i enrolled in EPAM Front-End Development training.
Following successful completion, the next step was passing the EPAM JS lab in spring 2022.
And must say frontend development is the sphere i'm interested in, i'm ready to discover it more and more.
My goal right now is to obtain enough practical skills to get a job offer. Ability to learn fast and sufficient level of English are with me.
